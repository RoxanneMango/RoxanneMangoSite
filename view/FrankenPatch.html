		FrankenPatch is a top-down RPG C++ game originally created for the 2022 Cozy Autumn Game Jam on itch.io. 
		Play as a character that gets transported during a thunder storm to a pumpkin field in a 
		doctor's backyard where you are assailed by ... zombies?! Uncover the town mystery 
		and find your way home, if you can!

		After the Cozy Autumn Jam ended, development on FrankenPatch continued to turn it into a more fleshed out game.
		The plan is to add an actual story-line and further implement more game engine features 
		like more sophisticated colission detection handling, rendering / shaders, music, and more cute pixel art!
		</br>
		</br>
		The game engine is made in conjunction with SFML for I/O handling and rendering. Compilation is done statically so 
		players don't have to pull in any of the dependencies themselves. The version of SFML being used is <u>SFML-2.6.1</u>.

		There was an optional palette and an optional mechanic to adhere to for the Jam. For FrankenPatch I choose to use the 
		Autumn Glow color palette for all assets, but not the One Room restriction (although in the end the demo is just one 
		'room' anyway, so task failed successfully?). The game itself did not score very high due to 
		the chaotic nature of the demo (evade these 20 zombies while breaking 100 pumpkins <i>AAAAA</i>), but people did say 
		the graphics were very nice! The graphics were made using AseSprite and saved as png texture packs.

	<h4>Build system</h4>
	<p>
		The building of the FrankenPatch code is automated using Makefiles. To allow for static linking, the SFML-2.6.1 library 
		was first compiled from source and the following macro definitions were added to the C++ flags: '-static' and '-DSFML_STATIC'.
		The first flag is to statically link the standard library into the executable, and the second one to signify for the SFML 
		library to do the same. Static linking is when you take the entirety of the code and absorb it into the final executable, 
		as opposed to dynamic linking, where you simply have a reference to the code that you will need. By linking statically you 
		remove dependency requirements (because they are compiled into the final program).

		Static linking has its pros and cons. Cons being that the size of your program will be much larger, and that if you need to 
		change anything in any of the pieces of code you will need to recompile the entire program again instead of just that one 
		thing. The main pro for me is that it compacts the code into one single point so you can ship one executable and it will just 
		<i>work</i>. I don't want to assume that every person has the required libraries pre-installed onto their computer. 
		To mitigate that problem they can be shipped seperately with the executable, 
		ofcourse, but this forces a rigid project structure where the program cannot be moved because it would  mess up the dynamic 
		linking. Dynamic linking is also slower in terms of performance, because these libraries need to be loaded in during
		runtime. I want to see how far I can go with the static linking; to see if I can really reduce FrankenPatch into one singular 
		executable containing all libraries, textures, music, etc.
		</br>
		</br>
		The build environment for FrankenPatch is made to work with Windows 10 right now, although I want to eventually make 
		it work for Linux as well. If you want to compile for Linux it shouldn't be too hard. All code in FrankenPatch is 
		cross-platform. Just compile SFML for your platform (follow the 'how to statically link with SFML' guide on the SFML 
		website to see how to do that correctly) and change the Makefile. Setting it up can be a bit of a pain, but once you've 
		done it you can leave it be.

	<h4>Image to Byte Array Converter</h4>
	<p>
		In my quest for static linking I wanted to try and encode my textures into the executable. To do so I wrote a program that 
		converts images into byte arrays. The program creates a header and a source file named after the image, puts in an extern 
		constant declaration for the byte array, and then defines it in the source file. The header file can then be included in 
		the FrankenPatch code so the SFML textures can load in the byte array instead of the image file on the disk. That way the 
		image gets completely absorbed into the code without any dependencies (the image file).

	<p>
		The generated texture byte arrays are compiled and moved around using Makefiles. The header files 
		get send to the include folder; the static library / archive gets send to the lib folder. The FrankenPatch 
		code automatically includes it via its own Makefile. The same process can probably be repeated for sound files 
		as well.
